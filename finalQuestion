Networking:
1: Difference in UDP, RMI, servlet and TCP/IP
2: Process of communication for TCP/IP, UDP, RMI (pseudo code,chart)
3: At what point one of the protocol has advantage over the others(more logical)
4: Function getHostName and getHostAddress
5: WebServer in mycourses(question on that)
6: Protocol FTP and UDP
7: Why is RMI slower
8: Difference btn bind and rebind?
9: What is serialize?
10: Heavy weight apps and light weight apps?
11: RMI process communication step by step
12: Multithreaded web server with constraints
13: How to avoid Denial Of Sevice?
14: Why are UnicastRemoteObject required?

Collections:
15: Difference in arraylist, linkedlist, binary tree, list
16: What is iterator and where are they used
17: Design interface using iterable
18: Pseudo code: BFS, DFS, inorder, preorder, postorder
18-a: Show the sequence of a elements for a traversal given a tree
19: Difference in comparable and comparator(pseudo code for the them). When to use either one
20: Why can't a list be sorted
21: How is arraylist and vector increased
22: Difference in hastable, hashmap and hashset
23: What is hashcode 
24: Pseudocode for equals method
25: Mechanisms to avoid collasion in hashmap
26: Given hashmap show which elements will collide(When will collasion occur)
26-a: Why is hashing used
26-b: How to retrieve desirable value from the hashmap(Equals method)

GUI:
27: List out layout style as manager
28: What is a GUI layout and examples of layout
29: How to implement an event handler(17.2 steps from hp's slide)
30: Show in code: action, event and action listener
31: List out types of layout manager
31-a: Explain the different layout(grid layout, flow layout)

Design patterns:
33: Why do we need design pattern
34: Major types of pattern
35: What is anti pattern
36: Where do design patterns occur in java

Reflection:
37: Why is reflection used
38: Define unit test, why is it used
39: Monitoring code using reflection api
40: Question like 15.5 in hp's slide(output of the code) passing different parameters to the a code


Generic questions: 
given code what is the output of the code(small web server question 5)
GUI: Given a gui what does it draw
Given a gui with event handlers what is the output(just the output nothing else){not convuluted,just the three component}

Notes:
Use drawing and arrows in GUI question no description
